Kupfer plugins
==============

Some custom Kupfer plugins.

To install a plugin - copy it's py file to `~/.local/share/kupfer/plugins/` directory and activate it in Kupfer.

Skype-chat
-----------------
Skype API is broken currently, so plugin is trying to use skype's CLI to open and focus chat windows. Use skype-contacts-export.sh script to populate contact list.
